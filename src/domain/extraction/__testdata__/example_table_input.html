                    The captured data is transferred to some location where it is converted into an
                    internal format understandable by the system (transcription). Today, digital
                    solutions tend to achieve the transmission electronically and sometimes the
                    transcription process is performed within the same device as the data capture,
                    thus not requiring transmission, other than some internal data transfer within
                    the device.

                    The captured data is converted (transcribed) into a computer-readable format.
                    Historically this would have been achieved by a data entry operator 'keying' the
                    data using a keyboard, but, again, modern digital solutions have a number of
                    options available, discussed later.
