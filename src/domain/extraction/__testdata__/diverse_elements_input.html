<p class="chapterOpenerText">What is risk?</p>
<p class="para">You'll get different answers depending on whom, and when, you ask. In 1999, risk didn't mean losing money; it meant making less money than someone else. What many people feared was bumping into somebody at a barbecue who was getting even richer even quicker by day trading dot-com stocks than they were. Then, quite suddenly, by 2003 risk had come to mean that the stock market might keep dropping until it wiped out whatever traces of wealth you still had left.</p>















<h3 class="chapterHeadA">The Risk is Not in Our Stocks, But in Ourselves</h3>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Risk exists in another dimension: inside you. If you overestimate how well you really understand an investment, or overstate your ability to ride out a temporary plunge in prices, it doesn't matter what you own or how the market does. Ultimately, financial risk resides not in what kinds of investments you have, but in what kind of investor you are. If you want to know what risk really is, go to the nearest bathroom and step up to the mirror. <span class="italic">That's</span> risk, gazing back at you from the glass.</p>
